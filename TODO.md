# TODO List

- Identify non-EmuClock clock signals
- Flexible trigger count (currently max. 32)
- Optimize checkpointing of RAM model contents
- Auto-assign address ranges for emulator AXI interfaces
- Clean dont-care bits in AXI response for determinism
- Variable scan chain width
- Handle "little-endian" wires in Verilog (MSB < LSB)
- Load init data in emulation
